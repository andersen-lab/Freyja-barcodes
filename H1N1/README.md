## Data sources
1. [GISIAD](https://gisaid.org/)

Freyjaâ€™s H1N1 barcodes are enabled by data and phylogenetic trees available from [GISAID]( https://gisaid.org/) EpiFlu. We gratefully acknowledge the authors from the originating laboratories that submitted the sequences, as well as the GISAID curation team (Freitas et al.), who built and annotated the phylogenetic trees used to extract lineage defining mutations.
